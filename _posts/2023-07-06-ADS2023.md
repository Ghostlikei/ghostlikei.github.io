## About this course

One of the well-developed courses from DaSE, ECNU, Instructor: [Yanhao Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/yhwang)

ADS course introduced three main parts for data science algorithms in undergraduate level, with mathmatical assignments and application projects:

1. Probablilty Inequality and Applications: Hashing, Sketch, Sampling

2. Matrix Decomposition: Markov Chain, Random Walk, Eigenvalue Computation, SVD/PCA

3. Linear Programming: LP algorithms, Integer Programming, Submodular Function, Community Detection
