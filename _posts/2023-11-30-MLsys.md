## Course Info

DLsys is an excellent open source introduction course to machine learning system. In this course, you are going to build a toy MLsys called `needle` from scratch to implement the modules like pytorch.

Lecturer: Tianqi Chen, [Personal Website](https://tqchen.com/)

## Assignments

I've completed hw0-2, which are the foundational parts for a dlsys:

- hw0: [Requirements](https://github.com/dlsyscourse/hw0/blob/main/hw0.ipynb), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/dlsys_hw0)

- hw1: [Requirements](https://github.com/dlsyscourse/hw1/blob/main/hw1.ipynb), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/dlsys_hw1)

Completed Forward Pass Operators, Topological Sort, Automatic Backward Propagation, ...

- hw2: [Requirements](https://github.com/dlsyscourse/hw2/blob/main/hw2.ipynb), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/dlsys_hw2)

Completed several `nn.Module` like modules, like initialization, loss, activations, layer norm, ...
