## Course Info

Amazing open source course to learn ideas about modern reinforcement learning. 

Lecturer: Sergey Levine, [Personal Website](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and his outstanding [Berkeley RAIL lab](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/)

### Course Website

- [CS285 latest version](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

### Lectures

Deep RL 2023 class is a well developed version. The lectures and videos are more challenging than previous versions.

## Assignments

Course assignment are separated into **theory** and **application** parts. I've completed hw1-3 model-free models and algorithms on Mujoco dataset.

- Homework 1: Imitation Learning: [Requirements](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/deeprlcourse/static/homeworks/hw1.pdf), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/homework_fall2023/tree/main/hw1).

Replicated **Behavioral Cloning** and **DAGGAR algorithm**

- Homework 2: Policy Gradients: [Requirements](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/deeprlcourse/static/homeworks/hw2.pdf), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/homework_fall2023/tree/main/hw2).

Replicated **Policy Gradients**, **Baseline**, **Generalized Advantage Estimation(GAE)**

- Homework 3: Q-learning and Actor-Critic Algorithms: [Requirements](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/deeprlcourse/static/homeworks/hw3.pdf), [Solution](https://github.com/Ghostlikei/homework_fall2023/tree/main/hw3)

Replicated **Deep Q-Networks(DQN)**, **Double Q-Learning(DDQN)**, **Actor-Critic**, **Reparameterize**, and **Soft Actor-Critic(SAC)**
